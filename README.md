# jbp-website
Welcome! This is the repository where the source code to my personal website (http://www.jacoboblandonpineda.tk). It's worth mentioning that I'm still learning how to do all of this, so all the code is pretty basic and rough as of right now.

The repository is structured on the same way as on the server, each branch is a folder containing the specific webpages and all.
The master branch contains the main page, es and en contain the locale variations for each language, but they're virtually the same.

If there's more info you need to know, contact me at jacoboblandonpineda@outlook.com
